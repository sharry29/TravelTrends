We were so glad to see you enjoying our shearing day event.  It does our heart good to see so many people enjoying these fine animals.  Please call me at 208-755-4925 as the beautiful alpaca 3X5 rug you took off the top rung cost $365 and the smaller 2x3 rugs below the large rug are $135.00 plus tax as marked.  This must have been the price you saw.  The tag for the large rug was on the other side of the rung.  We keep the prices on the ranch as low as we possibly can as you probably noticed from our charge of only $10 per person for a tour.  I am holding your check just in case you want to return the $365 lg rug.  Or you may do one of these options, pay the difference of $230 (we will pick up the 6% tax) or exchange it for a smaller rug of your choice.  We are so sorry for this confusion as the price for the large rug was at the other end of the pole and you must not have noticed.  I was so busy with shearing and not able to help you in the store where I could have prevented the error through no fault of yours. We do our best to clearly mark our goods.     Please let me know what you would like to do about this and we will get it straightened out.
